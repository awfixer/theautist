# hello

welcome to my website. I will blog about things i think about here.


## who am i

so i am awfixer, I am the founder of a few companies and do cool things on the internet. the main languages that I write are elixir, gleam, go and nix. Meaning that I write things that you dont care about unless they are broken :)


## what do I do now?

currently I am working on 3 things

### AWFixerOS

awfixeros is a new operating system inspired by [RedoxOS](https://redox-os.org) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and is being designed to be open, collaborative and future proof. you can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/awfixer-os)

### the AWApps

these are open source alternatives to your (least) favorite apps like google search, youtube, twitch and tiktok. They are going to use a cool monorepo structure i have been working on and you can learn more about them by checking out this github org [here](https://github.com/the-autists)


### awfixercom

this is a cool app that we are designing to address the current job market issue and understandable hatred and dislike of platforms like X, Linkedin and Indeed and help startups and the people who work for them integrate into the market in a way that does not require them to be bought out and controlled by a major tech company.
