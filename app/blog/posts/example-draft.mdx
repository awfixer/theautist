# Example Draft Post

This post demonstrates the **draft** feature. It's only visible when running `pnpm dev` in development mode.

## How Draft Posts Work

When you set `draft: true` in the frontmatter:

- ✅ Visible in development mode with a blue "Draft" badge
- ❌ Hidden in production builds
- ❌ Not included in sitemap.xml
- ❌ Not included in RSS feed

## Use Cases

Draft posts are perfect for:

1. **Work in Progress** - Write and preview before publishing
2. **Content Planning** - Keep upcoming posts in the repository
3. **Team Reviews** - Share drafts with collaborators
4. **Testing** - Try out new formatting or features

## Publishing This Post

To make this post live, simply remove the `draft: true` line from the frontmatter, or change it to `draft: false`.
