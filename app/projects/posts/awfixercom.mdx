# awfixercom, the community for modern business and employment talks

_this is a very broad overview of the idea behind awfixercom, you will be able to learn more when we launch the awfixercom landing page_

## what is awfixercom?

so I have been working with large comanies, small companies, startups, and the job seekers for a while now. And I have realized a few things when I have been doing that. The first is that LinkedIn sucks big ba**s and I hate it and with it on my worst enemies, the second is that indeed is not much better, and the third is that the way jobs work in this market has created a new market that I would like to build a cool company in.

### stage enter awfixercom

awfixercom is hard to describe in a short elevator pitch, and for copywrite reasons I will not give too much away at this time

- it is a place to find a job
- it is a place for companies to find talent
- it solves the hiring internally issue
- it helps people make enough money in this market
- it helps startups find solid talent
- it is a social network
- it is a business network
- it is resistant to AI
- it is open source (AGPLv3)
- it is super cool :)

lets break each of these down

## it is a place to find a job:

this is something that we have been really happy to research and look forward to implimenting. Finding a job right now is a horrible experience for a handful of reasons. The major ones are bad pay, unreal expectations, and ghost jobs. We plan on fighting this in a way that protects the companies and the job hunters. We believe in corporate loyalty, and we understand the world has changed. So we have thought of a modern corporate loyalty policy that is build on job security, rather that corporate loyalty. I will make another post explaining the idea behind this and update this one with the link in the future.

## it is a place for companies to find talent

this is sort of similar to the last point, though it is from the other side of the line, since we believe that this needs to be a partnership rather than a fight. We understand that companies deal with fake, or altered/doctored resumes as well and wish to help them fight this issue the same way that we hope to help job hunters get a fair chance applying to the jobs.
