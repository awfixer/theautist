# Example Project

This is an example project that demonstrates how the new MDX structure works with the simplified frontmatter.

## Features

- Clean frontmatter with only essential fields
- Project image displayed prominently
- Visit project button for external links
- Responsive design

## Technical Details

This project showcases modern web development practices including:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MDX** for content management

## Implementation

The project structure now uses only the essential frontmatter fields:

- `title` - The project name
- `description` - A brief description of the project
- `publishedAt` - The publication date
- `image` - The project image URL
- `link` - The external project URL

This simplified structure makes it easier to manage projects while still providing all the necessary information for display.
